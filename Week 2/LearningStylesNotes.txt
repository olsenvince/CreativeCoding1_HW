In this article I was very surprised to see that the results said students who used their preffered learning styles did not make particularly good progress. And that they simply weren't using the right kind of tools to help memorise the material. Though I do agree that we tend to put too much focus on "what type of person we are," as the article said. However I do know that I retain information better when I have to teach it to someone else. I had a job for 2 years that required me to memorise a lot of information, so I could then pass it on to customers and provide consultations. And I always was able to remember the informaton better after "teaching" it to my coworkers and having them quiz me at random. It's been over a year since I left that job and I still remember more than I ever remembered from high school. 
I am curious though on some of the learning techniques they mentioned in the article and I would like to try incorporating them into my own studying.
