What affected me the most in “Last Lecture,” was when he said “when you’re screwing up, and nobody’s saying anything to you anymore, that means they’ve given up.” In addition to “your critics are your ones still telling you they love you and care.” These really stuck with me because I’ve always really enjoyed genuine criticism. When I feel as though I’m not doing well -either in school or with my personal relationships- I look for someone to tell me how to do better. But I’ve never really seen how criticism can be a form of love until now, so it was really eye opening. 
	Overall Randy Pausch has a very positive view, especially in his condition. I was very surprised, you would think that someone nearing the end of his life so suddenly would be bitter about the things he was missing. I’ve known people who survived cancer, and have been a lot more glum for someone who’s made it through. His attitude towards it was somehow relieving in a way? I’m not dying of cancer and yet I found him to be relatable and was comforted by his lecture. 
Also, when Randy was talking to his old mentor about how his students have somehow surpassed everything he'd hoped, right off the bat too! I loved how his old mentor told him that in a situation like this, you dont know where to put the bar. And you would be doing them a disservice by placing it anywhere. In doing this, the students continued to do better and better works throughout the course. I'm going to try incorporating this into my own life, especially with my art. I am still learning, and by trying expect where I should be I think I'm cutting myself off too soon. 
It was a wonderful lecture to listen to, and its given me a lot to consider going forward.
