this is my file for my final project


process so far
(i apologise for the informal grammar, these are my notes and i type too fast to care)

this is the first time im taking notes in my Read Me file because i only just read that part in the instructions yippeee!!

(this semester has driven me crazy i swear)

I was planning on starting this last sunday, and getting the feel for the elements and techniques i planned on using 
ahaha that didnt happen. So i started on tuesday, got a rough feel for what I wanted and got to work with building my record player model. I used a tutorial by weidi on youtube for reference.

I swapped some of my inspirations from my proposal because I wasn't feeling it as much and also I was not gonna math out a cornu curve 

I want to making a click and drag function for the record players arm, when the arm is dragged over the record, whatever song there is will start to play. 

But I need a few things to make that happen:

#1 Well... I need an arm thingy for the record but its going to be a weird shape. (OMG WAIT COULD I USE AN ANGLE? LIKE A REALLY THICKLY DRAWN ANGLE!?!?! IS THERE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?!!?(more on this later)) I can do the shape, but I think I have to start with remaking my coordinates for the circles used in the record. 

For whatever reason the windowWidth and windowHeight get weird with the coordinates and I need them to be exact for this arm thingy to work. 

Yeah, there's probably an easy way to fix that without going through every circle and changing every width but i dont know it and I'm not desperate enough yet to spend hours googling for the exact thing im looking for (...yet)

#2 I need the arm to be able to rotate

#3 I need a mouse click event thing, which I honestly feel will be the easy part 

#4 I need a music... thing. A song definitely, I think I might be too short on time for a concept  where people can insert their own songs. So i'll go the easy route and pick one for you ahahaha. 

#5 I want the record to "spin" when the song is playing, I'm going to use reference from weidi's video on the arc stuff for this 

- I will need two arcs at once for there record.
- if two arcs on one record dont work make a second "layer" of the circles and add the other arc there? If i can get them to rotate at the right times it will either look really cool or no one will tell that there are two layers or both. 

This is basically just becoming a very complicated or just overly fancy sound vizualizer but also not??? Which i didn't want to do bc I had seen so many examples of them that I didn't want to do the boring thing and make another one. but now boy howdy I am kicking myself for not doing the easy thing. 

end of 05.03.24 notes its bed time and tomorrow will make me cry so I need to save my energy

things i need

- record player arm to rotate within certain boundaries

- record player arm to only rotate when pressed pause/ pressed play

- *record to on start spinning when pressed play

- *stop spinned when pressed pause

- *a song to start when "play" and stop when "pause"

- *moving text at bottom "song name" to exit one side of the screen and come back on the other

- *for the song to work TT-TT

  the ones with * are ones that i've finished, a lot of them had easier fixes than I had thought lol

  the only thing im struggling with now is the record arm. I could just get away with leaving it in place but i really think a click and drag or having it move on its own would be really cool. I've gotten it to the point where i wouldn't be scared about submitting it, because it works as mostly intended. But I still have some extra hours and I want to try moving that arm.

good luck to me ig
