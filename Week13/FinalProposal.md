For my final I want to create a painting with code, and make it interactive. Either with sound or mouse/arrow keys. I want it to do it's own thing in the background, but also have people be able to play with it a bit. 
I'm taking inspiration from Hailei Wang's "Tsunami." And also an interactive art installment in Portland called "Quantum Trampoline." 

If I decide to incorporate sound (either a song or the users voice) then I know I will need to learn some new snippets of code for that, especially for mic interaction. 

I know that since this is a creative piece with not much purpose, most of it is just going to be me tinkering with the forms of things until I like it or its interactive enough that I'm satisfied. 
I want to try and use as much of what we've learned this semester as possible. 

(The deadlines are just a rough idea)

Deadlines:

April 28th - have the basic color scheme, and simple shape movements. Randomized or pattern? Mouse, arrow/wasd keys, or sound? All three? Have the base layer started by then. aka "sketch day"

April 30th - User interaction capabilites, such as sound/keys/mouse

May 3rd - Making sure the user interaction and the code generated art in the background works fluidly together.  

May - 4th - finish any final adjustments and submit

I have not as of right now completed any work for my final, I have been busy with work and home life stuff that keeps popping up. I will get started as soon as I can, and have it submitted in time.
